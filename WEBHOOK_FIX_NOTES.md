# Webhook Authentication Error Fix

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ❌ Endpoint Mismatch
**Problem**: Webhooks were being sent to `/webhook` but the server only had `/cashfree-webhook` endpoint.

**Solution**: Added a new `/webhook` endpoint that properly handles the Cashfree webhook data structure.

### 2. ❌ Data Structure Mismatch  
**Problem**: The webhook data structure didn't match what the code expected.
- Expected: `{ orderId, txStatus }`
- Actual: `{ data: { order: { order_id }, payment: { payment_status } } }`

**Solution**: Updated data parsing to extract the correct fields from the actual webhook structure.

### 3. ❌ Firebase Authentication Error
**Problem**: `Error: 16 UNAUTHENTICATED` - Firestore requests were failing with authentication errors.

**Solutions Applied**:
- Added explicit `projectId` configuration
- Improved error handling for service account loading
- Added environment variable fallback support
- Added Firestore connection testing on startup
- Enhanced error logging for better debugging

### 4. ✅ Additional Improvements
- Better error handling in notification functions
- More detailed logging for webhook processing
- Support for production environment configurations
- Connection testing to verify Firestore access

## Key Changes Made

### Enhanced Firebase Initialization
```javascript
// Now supports both file and environment variable credentials
// Explicit project ID configuration
// Better error handling and logging
```

### New Webhook Endpoint
```javascript
app.post('/webhook', async (req, res) => {
  // Handles the actual Cashfree webhook structure
  // Proper data validation and extraction
  // Enhanced error handling
});
```

### Improved Data Processing
- Extracts `order_id` from `data.order.order_id`
- Extracts `payment_status` from `data.payment.payment_status`
- Stores additional payment metadata (amount, time, etc.)
- Sends notifications on successful payments

## Testing

Use `test_webhook.js` to test the webhook endpoint:
```bash
# Start the server
node webhook_server.js

# In another terminal, run the test
node test_webhook.js
```

## Deployment Notes

### Environment Variables (Optional)
If you can't use the service account file, set:
```bash
export FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT='{"type":"service_account",...}'
```

### Production Configuration
Set `NODE_ENV=production` for production deployments.

## Authentication Troubleshooting

If you still get authentication errors:

1. **Verify service account permissions** in Firebase Console
2. **Check project ID** matches your Firebase project
3. **Ensure service account key** is not expired
4. **Verify network connectivity** to Firebase services
5. **Check IAM roles** - service account needs Firestore access

The server now provides detailed error messages to help identify the specific authentication issue.
